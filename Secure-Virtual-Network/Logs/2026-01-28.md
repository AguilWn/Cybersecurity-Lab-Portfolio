# 📅 Technical Activity Log: January 28, 2026

**Project Phase:** Virtual Infrastructure Deployment, OS Provisioning & Hardening  
**Status:** Completed Baseline Setup  

---

## 1. Environment Troubleshooting & Optimization
* **Root Cause Analysis (Hypervisor):** Identified that the previous VirtualBox "Fatal Error" was caused by directory permission conflicts on the secondary storage drive.
* **System Remediation:** Performed a deep system clean using **Revo Uninstaller** to remove orphaned registry keys and files from the failed installation attempt.
* **Directory Redirection:** Accessed Global Preferences and successfully redirected the **Default Machine Folder** to `D:\Virtual Machines`.
* **Outcome:** This resolved the visibility issue for network management tools and ensured high-volume VM data is stored on secondary storage, preserving system drive performance.

## 2. Virtual Machine Provisioning (Ubuntu-SOC-Lab)
* **Hardware Allocation:** Built a virtual server "shell" with the following specifications:
    * **Memory:** 2048 MB RAM.
    * **Processor:** 2 Virtual CPUs.
    * **Storage:** 25.00 GB Virtual Hard Disk (VDI).
    * **Reference Image:**

* **Network Segmentation:** Configured a dedicated **NAT Network** (`10.0.2.0/24`) to isolate the lab environment from the host machine while allowing internal multi-node communication.

## 3. OS Installation & Secure Implementation
* **Boot Initiation:** Mounted the Ubuntu 25.10 Server ISO and initiated the first-time boot via the GNU GRUB bootloader.
* **Principle of Least Functionality:** During the installation phase, I deliberately bypassed all "Featured Server Snaps" (e.g., AWS-CLI, PowerShell). 
* **Security Justification:** This reduces the initial attack surface by ensuring only essential services are running on the management server.
* **Identity Management:** Established a professional naming convention:
    * **Hostname:** `soc-mgmt-01`.
    * **User Profile:** `soc-admin`.
* **Reference Image:**

## 4. Post-Deployment Hardening & Patch Management
* **Update Execution:** Logged into the new system and executed `sudo apt update` and `sudo apt upgrade -y`.
* **Vulnerability Mitigation:** Confirmed that critical system packages, including `apparmor`, `linux-firmware`, and `snapd`, were updated to eliminate "Day 0" risks from the base image.
    * **Reference Image:**
    * ![Patch Management](../Images/ubuntu-first-upgrade.png)
* **Host-Based Firewall (UFW):**
    * **Action:** Implemented the **Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW)** with a "Default Deny" incoming policy.
    * **Ruleset:** Authorized SSH (Port 22) traffic while restricting all other unsolicited inbound connections.
    * **Status:** Verified active status via `sudo ufw status verbose`.

## 5. Summary of Progress
By the end of this session, the primary SOC management node is fully updated, isolated in a private network, and hardened against unauthorized access. This established a secure baseline for future deployment of monitoring tools (e.g., Wazuh or Wireshark).
