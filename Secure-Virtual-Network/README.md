# Building a Secure Virtualized Network Environment
**Author:** Wennymar Aguil  
**Category:** Virtualization / Systems Administration / Security Foundations  
**Status:** In Progress (Started January 2026)

## 1. Executive Summary
The goal of this project is to design and deploy a controlled laboratory environment using Oracle VM VirtualBox. This lab serves as a secure "sandbox" to practice network monitoring, patch management, and security testing without risking host machine integrity. By configuring a Linux-based server (Ubuntu) alongside a Windows client, I am establishing a cross-platform environment for analyzing system telemetry and practicing SOC Analyst workflows.

## 2. Tools & Technologies
* **Hypervisor:** Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.2.4
* **Operating Systems:** Ubuntu Server 25.10 (Linux), Windows 10/11 (Evaluation)
* **Networking:** VirtualBox NAT Network (10.0.2.0/24)
* **Methodology:** Principle of Least Functionality & System Hardening
